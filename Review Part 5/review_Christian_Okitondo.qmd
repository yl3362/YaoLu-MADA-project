# Overview

Title of project: Explore of COVID-19 spread speed related factors

Name of project author(s): Yao Lu

Name of project reviewer: Christian Okitondo



## Background, Context and Motivation
How well is the context of the project described? Is a comprehensive background, including summary of previous/related work given? Is the project well placed into the context of existing work (including proper referencing of existing work). Is it clear why the project was undertaken and what new information it hopes to provide?

### Feedback and Comments

Although the project title seems like a very nice study, I suggest that you say a bit more in the abstract to give an overview of what this project is about. Few sentences providing the backgroound, methods, results, and discussion section. I found the abstract to be a very important component of any manuscript. That's really what will make someone be captured to read the entire project or not.  

### Summary assessment 
* some contextualization and motivation


## Question description
How well and clear are the question(s)/hypotheses the project aims to address described? Is it clear how the questions relate to the data?


### Feedback and Comments
The research question of whether the coverage of the vaccine decreases the spread of COVID is clearly stated. However, the question of "Which factors influence the speed of COVID spread?" does not directly relate to the stated research question. It would be helpful to provide more clarity on how this question is relevant to the overall project goals.

The hypothesis that the speed of COVID spread is related to vaccine coverage is also clear, but it would be beneficial to provide more detail on how this hypothesis will be tested using the data. Additionally, it would be useful to specify what is meant by "crude model" and how it will be applied to test the relationship between vaccine coverage and the speed of COVID spread.

Overall, while the research question is clear, there could be more clarity and detail provided on the questions and hypotheses being addressed and how they relate to the data. 

### Summary assessment
* Question/hypotheses somewhat explained


## Data description
How well is the data overall described? Is the source provided? Is a codebook or other meta-information available that makes it clear what the data is? 

### Feedback and Comments

- While some information is provided about the data, there could be more detail and context provided on the variables and any data cleaning or transformation steps taken. - Data source and codebook was provided.

### Summary assessment

Source and overall structure of data well explained


## Data wrangling and exploratory analysis
How well is the data cleaned/processed and explored? Are all steps reasonable and well explained? Are alternatives discussed and considered? Are meaningful exploratory results shown (e.g. in the supplementary materials)?

### Feedback and Comments
It would be helpful to see some basic descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for some demographics variables.  

I like the plots you used. It gave an overal idea of your data.

### Summary assessment
Essentially no weaknesses in wrangling and exploratory component



## Appropriateness of Analysis
Were the analysis methods appropriate for the data? Was the analysis done properly? Were different components of the analysis (e.g. performance measure, variable selection, data pre-processing, model evaluation) done in the best way possible and explained well?

### Feedback and Comments

The analysis part is well-explained and presented in a good layout. Made good use of the statistical models approach.

### Summary assessment

* strong and reasonable analysis


## Presentation
How well are results presented? Are tables and figures easy to read and understand? Are the main figures/tables publication level quality? 

### Feedback and Comments
The plots and tables for EDA are really nice. The tables are also nice, clearly done and labelled. Good job on this!


### Summary assessment
* results are very well presented



## Discussion/Conclusions
Are the study findings properly discussed? Are strengths and limitations acknowledged? Are findings interpreted properly?

### Feedback and Comments
The findings are properly discussed and interpreted, and strengths and limitations are acknowledged. The limitations of the study, such as the potential bias due to not all infected people being tested, are recognized and the potential explanations for the findings are explored. The use of both basic linear analysis and machine learning methods is also a strength of the study.
I don't have much to add on this. 

### Summary assessment
* strong, complete and clear discussion


## Further comments
Project heading in the right direction. The statistical analysis is well done. The structure is correct. Maybe to just add a bit more in the abstract and make some words clear in the methods section. 



# Overall project content evaluation
Evaluate overall features of the project  by filling in the sections below.


## Structure
Is the project well structured? Are files in well labeled folders? Do files have reasonable names? Are all "junk" files not needed for analysis/reproduction removed? By just looking at files and folders, can you get an idea of how things fit together?

### Feedback and Comments
The project is well structured and labelled with appropriate names. There is no irrelevant or redundant file. It was fairly easy to reproduce everything by following the instructions. 


### Summary assessment
* well structured


## Documentation 
How well is the project documented? Are you able to understand each step of the whole analysis, each decision that was made, and each line of code? Is enough information provided as comments in code or as part of Rmd files? 

### Feedback and Comments

Each step of the whole analysis is well-explained. There are plenty of comments justifying and stating the purpose of each line of code.

### Summary assessment

* fully and well documented



## Reproducibility
Are all results fully reproducible? Is documentation provided which clearly explains how to reproduce things, and does it work without the need for any manual intervention? Are you able to re-run the whole analysis without having to do manual interventions/edits?

### Feedback and Comments

All results are fully reproducible and the readme.me file under each folder provides clear guidance. 

### Summary assessment
* fully reproducible without issues


## Thoroughness
How thorough was the overall study? Were alternatives (e.g. different ways of processing the data or different models) considered? Were alternatives discussed? Were the questions/hypotheses fully and thoroughly addressed?

### Feedback and Comments

Overall, the project is well writtend and properly analyzed. With edits taking into consideration, it will make a good one.

### Summary assessment
* decent level of thoroughness
